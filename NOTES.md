# Stock Watcher Developer Notes

## Notes about test

This test is super in-depth and is good if you have 4 hours or more.
My feedback and notes about the work I've done so far
1. the data API has crappy structure very difficult to work with with its poor data key names... required extra time to massage the data
2. the search box has a lot of special cases to handle for with auto complete and search suggestions
3. API needs throttling an didn't have time to put that in place
4. and because the API was so hammered they set the throttle really high pain to develop with
5. Error handling is not addressed well because of all the other concerns to handle
6. building detailed components AND making them responsive is quite the task for a "1 hour test"
7. I didn't do any work to tweak for all the responsive layouts so I let the font scaling and flex-box and grid do most of the work here, read: there are responsive bugs
8. I like the spirit of this test but it is a bit much to ask when you could find out a devs capabilities with a hands on tech interview with pseudo code and such.
9. the work and thus the test is not complete. if that's ok great. if not... I would have liked to have spent my time doing something else.
10. Hopefully helps you guys and conveys my abilities.
11. My other abilities are not covered here they include but not limited to; UI/UX, wireframing, journey mapping, storyboarding, graphic design, illustration, etc.
